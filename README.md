# Fullstack Developer
### Hello, world!
I'm a fullstack developer with a strong focus on backend architecture and API design driven by the vision of using technology to liberate people from the boundaries of time and space.<br/>
My main stack includes Node.js, TypeScript, Express, React, and Next.js.<br/>
Currently, I'm deepening my understanding of AWS, serverless (Lambda), and cloud infrastructure to build more robust and production-ready services.<br/>
